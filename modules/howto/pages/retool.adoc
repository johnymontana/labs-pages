Retool is a UI-building application that can help users integrate data from various sources and build components for analyzing and displaying that data.

== What Is Retool?

It is a low-code tool for building interfaces and visual components for diverse data sources. Retool offers simple, yet configurable, drag-and-drop components that users can map showing results from various data sources and queries. From dashboards to analysis and more, Retool provides a quick and easy ramp for users to show their data in meaningful ways. It also has capabilities for adding query scheduling and triggers.

Per Retool's https://docs.retool.com/docs/whats-retool[documentation^], the following are the core functionalities it provides:

1. Connect your data sources - 20+ options, including traditional data stores and APIs like GraphQL.
2. Build your queries and logic in SQL or Javascript.
3. Connect your queries and logic to prebuilt components like tables, text inputs, and charts.
4. Organize and connect your components into an application to anlayze the data or share with others.

== Why Use Retool With Neo4j?

There are a few different reasons why developers/analysts might choose Retool over other visualization or dashboarding options.

1. Build a quick UI with the drag-and-drop components for a demo or presentation.
2. Track internal progress or stats by pulling data from various sources into one, clean UI.
3. Create a user interface for triggering or scheduling queries based on user input or analysis.

== Architecture Overview

To interact between the two technologies, we can use the common integration Retool and Neo4j both support - GraphQL. Retool's https://docs.retool.com/docs/graphql[GraphQL integration^] uses it as a data resource, and Neo4j's https://neo4j.com/labs/grandstack-graphql/[GraphQL integration^] uses it to expose graph data in an easily-consumable format.

== How To

=== Libraries / Packages

There are 3 components needed for working using Retool with Neo4j.

1. Neo4j - launch a local or hosted database instance with one of the following methods:
a. Sandbox - temporary, hosted instance that is set up with a few clicks (free).
b. Desktop - local instance created from the Neo4j Desktop application (requires download).
c. Hosted - launch a remote instance with nearly any cloud provider (usually requires some cost).

2. GraphQL - create a GraphQL layer to interact between the database and application. There are a couple of different ways to approach deploying a GraphQL integration on top of Neo4j, both of which are listed below.
a. One-click deployment with Neo4j Sandbox - feature https://medium.com/neo4j/sandbox-spring-cleaning-38689661dece[blog post^] (see section on driver examples).
b. Self-deployment on local machine or with most cloud service providers - walkthrough https://blog.grandstack.io/awwws-serverless-graphql-and-neo4j-d5536a32f1a0[blog post^].

3. Retool - build your application in one of two ways.
a. From the Retool https://retool.com/[website^] (can sign up for an account).
b. With Retool https://docs.retool.com/docs/embedding-retool[embedded^] in another page or application.
